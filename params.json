If you are only interested in installing this utility, you can do so by installing application using setup in WCFLoadUISetupOutput/setup.exe folder.\r\n\r\nI  created this utility during my spare time and as of now this utility lacks in a lot of features, which I am working on.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute, please drop in an email at (lokeshlal [at] gmail.com).\r\n\r\nHopefully someone may find this useful.\r\n\r\n###### Limitations:\r\n1. Utility assumes that one WSDL contains one and only one service.",
